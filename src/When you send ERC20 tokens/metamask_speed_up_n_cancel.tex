\begin{itemize}
  \item You may ``speed up'' or ``cancel'' a pending transaction. Both require higher gas price.
  \item ``Speed Up'' resends the same transaction except the gas price.
  \item ``Cancel'' resends ``transfer zero ethers to self'' transaction with the same nonce and higher gas price.
  \item Metamask advises to use at least 10\% higher \texttt{maxPriority} and at least 30\% higher \texttt{maxFee}.
  \item Geth replaces a transaction with the same nonce if both \texttt{maxPriority} and \texttt{maxFee} are at least 10\% (\texttt{PriceBump} parameter) higher.
  \item But transaction replacement is not guaranteed all times.
